Carbonfly consists of two key components: 

1. a Python library that implements the core functionality and provides the necessary interfaces, and 
2. a Grasshopper toolbox that exposes these features through a user-friendly graphical interface.

## FAQ

### Q1: Does Carbonfly support other OpenFOAM versions, such as v8, for use with urbanMicroclimateFoam?

Yes and no. 

You can use most Carbonfly components with OpenFOAM v8 to generate a case and run blockMesh, surfaceFeature, 
snappyHexMesh, and checkMesh.

However, the `buoyantReactingFoam` solver that Carbonfly uses for CO2 simulations is not available in 
OpenFOAM v8. To use [urbanMicroclimateFoam](https://github.com/OpenFOAM-BuildingPhysics/urbanMicroclimateFoam) 
with OpenFOAM v8, for example, you need to edit `run_foam_console()` or better add a new one to `wsl.py` for your 
specific usage. Depending on the solver you used, you may also need to adjust the boundary conditions.

If you would like to try OpenFOAM v8, please follow the steps below:

1. Install OpenFOAM v8 by following the official guide: https://openfoam.org/download/8-ubuntu/

2. Use `/opt/openfoam8/etc/bashrc` as the input for `foam_bashrc`, see the example with Carbonfly `blockMesh` below:

### Q2: Why does Carbonfly use WSL instead of blueCFD-Core?

Carbonfly uses WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) on Windows 10 or 11 as a bridge to learning and working with 
native OpenFOAM. Most advanced applications and research workflows are ultimately more convenient in WSL or 
a pure Linux environment.

In contrast, blueCFD-Core offers only a limited selection of OpenFOAM versions, and it also requires a separate 
installation process. The effort required for the latter is roughly comparable to setting up WSL. 
Therefore, adopting WSL provides a more flexible, future-proof solution for beginners and advanced users alike.

### Q3: How can I add a new boundary condition in Carbonfly?

Below are the steps to create a custom boundary condition for your use:

1. Check the classes in `carbonfly/boundary.py` to see if your needed boundary condition is already defined.

2. If so, you can use it directly in Grasshopper. For reference, see the scripts for each GH User Object in `carbonfly/grasshopper/XXXXXX.py`.

3. If not: 

   1. Add a new class in `carbonfly/boundary.py`
   
   2. Update `field_writer.py` for example `_field_block_text()`
