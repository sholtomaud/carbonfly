How to install?
---------------

Step 1: Install WSL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In Windows 10 or 11, install WSL 2 with Ubuntu-20.04 (should also work with Ubuntu-22.04, not tested) in a terminal window (e.g. PowerShell), also see `WSL Documentation - How to install Linux on Windows with WSL <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install>`_:

1. ``wsl --install -d Ubuntu-20.04``

      :alt: install wsl Ubuntu-20.04
      :width: 100%

2. Open ``Ubuntu 20.04 LTS``, you will see the following console. Please set up your WSL, also see `Set up a WSL development environment <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/setup/environment#set-up-your-linux-username-and-password>`_

3. Once you have finished setting up, you should see the following welcome message:

Step 2: Install OpenFOAM v10
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Install OpenFOAM v10 in WSL - Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (should be able to find it in the Windows menu, with an orange icon), also see `Download v10 | Ubuntu <https://openfoam.org/download/10-ubuntu/>`_:

1. ``sudo sh -c "wget -O - https://dl.openfoam.org/gpg.key > /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/openfoam.asc"``
2. ``sudo add-apt-repository http://dl.openfoam.org/ubuntu``
3. ``sudo apt-get update``
4. ``sudo apt-get -y install openfoam10``

.. note::
   Tip: Ctrl+V doesn't work in Ubuntu, use right-click to paste

As described in OpenFOAM documentation, complete the following:

5. Find the ``.bashrc`` file in the user's home directory, e.g. using Windows File Explorer: ``Linux/Ubuntu-20.04/home/user/.bashrc`` and open the file using any text editor app e.g. `Notepad 3 <https://github.com/rizonesoft/Notepad3>`_

   .. image:: ../../pics/install_openfoam_01.png

6. At the bottom of that file, add ``source /opt/openfoam10/etc/bashrc`` and save the file.

   .. image:: ../../pics/install_openfoam_02.png
      :alt: add openfoam in .bashrc file
      :width: 100%

7. Restart WSL and test with ``simpleFoam -help`` in a new WSL window:

Step 3: Install Carbonfly
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Manual installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Download ``.zip`` file (or source code) of latest release from `Releases <https://github.com/RWTH-E3D/carbonfly/releases>`_
2. Unzip the file
3. Copy the ``carbonfly`` folder to the Rhino 8 script path: ``%AppData%\McNeel\Rhinoceros\8.0\scripts``

   .. note::
      Note: If you have just installed Rhino, the ``scripts`` folder may not yet exist. Please manually create a new ``scripts`` folder at this path ``%AppData%\McNeel\Rhinoceros\8.0``.

4. Copy the ``Carbonfly`` folder (under ``grasshopper/UserObjects``) to the ``%AppData%\Grasshopper\UserObjects``

   .. note::
      Note: If you have just installed Rhino, the ``Grasshopper`` folder may not yet exist. Please run Grasshopper in your Rhino first. The folder will be created after the first run.

   .. image:: ../../pics/manual_installation_copy_grasshopper_user_objects.png
      :alt: manual installation copy grasshopper user objects
      :width: 100%

5. Restart Rhino and Grasshopper. You should now see Carbonfly in the tabs:

6. To help you get started quickly, we've prepared numerous examples. See `Examples <./examples>`_.

Step 4: Install ParaView (optional)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Although `ParaView <https://www.paraview.org/>`_ (for post-processing) should be automatically installed in the WSL environment during OpenFOAM v10 installation, it is still recommended to install an additional `ParaView <https://www.paraview.org/>`_ instance in the Windows environment. This allows for more convenient viewing of results and post-processing after simulations.

After simulation, simply double-click the automatically generated ``.foam`` file in the Carbonfly case folder (see `Examples <./examples>`_) to open ParaView and view simulation results for post-processing:

4. (Optional) Uninstall the Linux distribution you installed like ``Ubuntu 20.04 LTS`` from the "Apps & features" or "Installed apps" settings in Windows.

.. note::
   In Windows Terminal, you can use the command ``wsl -l`` to check all installed Linux distributions.
